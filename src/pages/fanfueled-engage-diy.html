			<h2>FanFueled Engage DIY</h2>
			<p>
				FanFueled is an engagement marketing company that builds social gaming solutions for brands, artists and festivals. We use patented software to track the ripple of influence, incentivizing peer to peer marketing.
			</p><p>
				Engage is a social gaming platform where users can engage in their daily social interactions with brands, artists and festivals. Users earn points for completing the social actions, so by accumulating a certain number of points users will be able to redeem them for prizes or rewards or offers from the brand or artist or festivals.
			</p><p>
				Fan fueled engage is built ground up with mobile in mind. Each engage platform should be able to accommodate all the social interactions such as Facebook likes, tweets and checkin's. Other actions such as watching YouTube videos, listening to songs, completing custom quiz, purchases and many other can be added to an engage platform.
			</p><p>
				Each platform can have up to 40 actions on average and 20 varieties or rewards. Some engage platforms can pull up to 30,000 users. There is a leaderboard for each engage displayed up to 12 places to show the competition for the prizes.
			</p><p>
				So with above numbers in mind, it's hard for our marketing teams to take of all the actions and rewards on 100s of such platforms and it takes a lot if development time to update data based on sales teams requests.
				So the engage DIY was created to help the brand owners, artist managers and festival mangers to manage the engage platform on their own.
			</p><p>
				DIY should be able to help above clients to create, modify and delete actions, rewards and award players with prizes. It should also facilitate for adding or deleting points from users, see any fraud activity and also importantly see the statistics on how their platforms are performing.
			</p><p>
				The DIY is built to make it easier for clients to add actions and rewards with ease. They can choose the actions, rewards types they want to add and a preview of it is shown in real time. Clients can also manage the order of actions, rewards, edit and delet using simple drag and drop feature. They also can view the stats for the platform, download user reports and add/delete user points.
