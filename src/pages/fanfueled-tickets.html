			<h2>FanFueled Tickets</h2>
			<p>
				FanFueled is a DIY event hosting and ticket selling platform. Event host can create an event and sell multiple types of tickets. A user can purchase a ticket for an event. This ticket is sent to user email address as a PDF file. This method had the following drawbacks:
				<ul>
					<li>Information was not well organized</li>
					<li>PDF creation was process intensive</li>
					<li>PDF size is big for Mobiles</li>
					<li>Access to tickets was not easy</li>
					<li>Printing of tickets right after the purhcase was not possible.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				To solve the above issues, Redesign was needed. The new solution is a html based ticket which solves the above issues. Information is well organized with redesign, HTML ticket creation is easy and faster. HTML solution is responsive and is mobile friendly. Access to tickets is easier and is available for print right away.
